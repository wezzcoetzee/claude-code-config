## Comment Policy

### Unacceptable Comments
- Comments that repeat what code does
- Commented-out code (delete it)
- Obvious comments ("increment counter")
- Comments instead of good naming

### Principle
Code should be self-documenting. If you need a comment to explain WHAT the code does, consider refactoring to make it clearer.
